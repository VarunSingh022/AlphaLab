# [2.1.0] - 2026-09-04

## Overview

AlphaLab 2.1.0 is "Execution + Portfolio Correctness". It makes the existing
execution spine reliable rather than adding new packages: mark-to-market,
separated portfolio accounting, explicit execution invariants, and the fix for
the O(N^2) event accumulation that stopped the risk benchmark from completing.

No new packages. No new domain models. `PortfolioState` remains the single
canonical portfolio state and `oms.order.Order` the single lifecycle order.

---

## Breaking Changes

- **Engine histories are `AppendOnlyLog`, not `tuple`.** `RiskState`,
  `MarketState`, `ExecutionState`, `OMSState`, `AllocationState`,
  `PortfolioState`, `TransactionLedger` and the `ExecutionPipelineState`
  accumulators now hold `alphalab.common.AppendOnlyLog`. It is an immutable
  `Sequence` and compares equal to tuples and lists, so `len()`, indexing,
  slicing, iteration, `in`, `reversed()` and `== (...)` are unchanged. Code that
  required a literal `tuple` (`isinstance(..., tuple)`, tuple concatenation with
  `+`) must call `.to_tuple()`.
- **`PortfolioEngine.apply_fill` rejects malformed fills** with
  `InvalidTransactionError`: zero quantity, non-positive price, or negative
  commission. These previously produced an incoherent position or ledger entry.
- **A venue-rejected or expired execution is now terminal for the OMS order.**
  The order moves to `REJECTED` / `EXPIRED` and leaves `active_orders`;
  previously it stayed `ACCEPTED` and open forever. `Order.reject` accordingly
  accepts `ACCEPTED` in addition to `NEW` / `PENDING`.
- **One portfolio snapshot per market event**, not one per fill.
  `ExecutionPipelineState.portfolio_snapshots` now also has a point for events
  that only marked the book and did not trade.
- **`AnalyticsEngine.compile_report`, `AllocationEngine.allocate` and
  `calculate_attribution`** accept `Sequence` where they previously required
  `tuple`. Existing tuple callers are unaffected.

---

## Added

- **Mark-to-market.** `PortfolioEngine.update_market_prices` is now wired into
  `ExecutionPipeline.process_market_event` and runs *before* the strategy sees
  the event, so strategy, allocation and risk all decide against a portfolio
  valued at the current market. It moves unrealized P&L only -- cash, realized
  P&L, commissions and the ledger are untouched. Non-positive prices are
  rejected as invalid market data and unheld assets are ignored; a position with
  no price keeps its previous mark. Emits `MarketValueUpdated` when something was
  actually re-marked.
- **`PortfolioValuation.snapshot` / `PortfolioValuationSnapshot`** -- the
  deterministic read model over `PortfolioState`: cash, long/short/positions
  value, unrealized and realized P&L, commissions, and equity. Carried on
  `ExecutionPipelineResult.valuation` and projected into the analytics
  `PortfolioSnapshot`. Not a second portfolio state.
- **`PortfolioState.realized_pnl` and `PortfolioState.commission_paid`** --
  cumulative account totals that survive a position being closed and dropped
  from `positions`. They satisfy the accounting identity
  `equity == deposits - withdrawals + realized_pnl + unrealized_pnl - commission_paid`,
  which the new invariant tests assert after every operation.
- **`ExecutionPipelineResult.unpriced_requests`** -- order requests dropped
  because the pipeline had no market price for the asset.
- **`alphalab.common.AppendOnlyLog`** -- immutable append-only sequence with
  O(1) amortized append and copy-on-branch structural sharing.
- **`benchmarks/benchmark_execution_pipeline.py`** -- end-to-end pipeline
  throughput and scaling benchmark.
- Tests: `tests/unit/common/test_append_log.py`,
  `tests/unit/portfolio/test_portfolio_invariants.py`,
  `tests/integration/test_mark_to_market_pipeline.py`,
  `tests/regression/test_event_accumulation_complexity.py`.

---

## Fixed

- **O(N^2) event/history accumulation.** Every engine grew its append-only
  history with `(*state.events, event)`, rebuilding the whole tuple on each
  transition; N transitions copied O(N^2) elements.
  Measured on the development machine, with full history retained in every case:

  | Benchmark | v2.0.0 | v2.1 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `benchmark_risk_engine` (100k evaluations) | 285.7s | **1.4s** |
  | `benchmarks_market_engine` (100k quotes) | 2,060 ops/sec | **163,816 ops/sec** |
  | `benchmarks_market_engine` (100k books) | 640 ops/sec | **165,970 ops/sec** |
  | `benchmark_portfolio_engine` (20k fills) | 1.90s | **0.22s** |
  | `benchmark_execution_pipeline` (4000 events) | 6.76s | **~1.8-2.2s** |

  `benchmark_risk_engine` was 9.5x outside its own 30s budget on v2.0.0.
  `benchmark_portfolio_engine`'s full 100k-fill workload could not complete on
  v2.0.0 at all; v2.1 runs it in 1.8s. End-to-end, the pipeline benchmark's
  scaling across a 4x workload dropped from ~17x to ~8x.
- **Realized P&L was discarded when a position closed.** Closing removes the
  position from `positions`, taking its `realized_pnl` with it, so account-level
  realized P&L was unrecoverable after a round trip. It now accumulates on
  `PortfolioState`.
- **Analytics trade records could be credited with another fill's P&L.**
  `ExecutionPipeline._trade_record` scanned the whole portfolio history in
  reverse for the asset's last realized-P&L event, so an opening fill inherited
  an earlier close's P&L. It now reads only the events the current fill
  produced.
- **An order for an asset with no market price raised `KeyError`.** Allocation
  prices unknown assets at `0.00`; the pipeline now drops such requests before
  the OMS and reports them on `unpriced_requests`. The condition is per-event --
  a later quote makes the asset tradeable.
- **Venue-rejected orders stayed open forever** in `oms.active_orders`, so open
  orders never reconciled with fills.
- **Positions were never repriced between fills**, so unrealized P&L, NAV, risk
  NAV and the equity curve were stale until the next trade.
- **`benchmarks/benchmarks_market_engine.py` could never run.** Its first quote
  carried timestamp `0.0`, which `market.timestamp.is_valid_timestamp` rejects as
  not strictly positive, so the benchmark raised `MarketValidationError`
  immediately. The sequence now starts at `1.0`. (Pre-existing on v2.0.0; found
  while validating the v2.1 benchmark runs.)

---

## Not Changed

- The D1 close-fill cash accounting fix from 2.0.0 stands: realized P&L is still
  never added to cash on top of the trade proceeds.
- Commissions still stay out of a position's cost basis; `average_cost` remains
  a clean price.
- No package was added, removed, or merged. The standalone-engine /
  integrated-path split from ADR-0009 is unchanged.

---

## Known Limitations

- **The OMS order book is the execution path's remaining super-linear term.**
  `OrderBook.add` / `.replace` copy the whole order dict and
  `OMSEngine._update_sets` copies both order-id frozensets, once per stored
  order. This is a persistent-map problem, not event accumulation, and was
  deliberately left out of 2.1.0's scope. `benchmarks/benchmark_execution_pipeline.py`
  measures it.
- **Valuation is single-currency.** `PortfolioValuation` and `NAVCalculator`
  value the base currency only.
- **`_trade_record` still hard-codes** `sector_id="UNCLASSIFIED"` and
  `holding_period_seconds=0.0` ("D3", deferred).

---

## Quality Gates

`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy` (strict, 840 source files), `pytest`
(1273 tests), `git diff --check`, `python -m build`, and `twine check dist/*`
all pass.

# [2.0.0] - 2026-09-04

## Overview

AlphaLab 2.0.0 is the v2 release line. It consolidates the v1.34.0–v1.46.0 engine
series, adds four new standalone packages, unifies the canonical execution-path
domain models, and fixes two portfolio/analytics defects found by an end-to-end
trading-research validation.

AlphaLab remains a library: there is no server, daemon, scheduler process, or CLI.
`alphalab.runtime.ExecutionPipeline` is the only spine that wires domain engines
together (market → strategy → allocation → risk → OMS → execution simulator →
portfolio → analytics); every other package is an independent, individually tested
engine that is not fused into a single runtime.

---

## Breaking Changes

Public symbols removed or changed. Import sites must be updated.

- **`alphalab.core.OrderRequest` is now the single proposed-order DTO.** The
  independent `alphalab.allocation.request.OrderRequest` /
  `alphalab.allocation.request.OrderSide` and the independent
  `alphalab.risk.models.OrderRequest` / `alphalab.risk.models.OrderSide` are
  removed. `alphalab.allocation.request` no longer exists. `alphalab.risk.models`
  now contains only `RiskViolation`. `OrderSide` is no longer part of the
  `alphalab.allocation` or `alphalab.risk` public API — use
  `alphalab.core.enums.Side`.
- **`alphalab.core.enums.Side` is the canonical order direction** everywhere on
  the execution path (`OrderRequest`, `oms.order.Order`, `Fill`, `Trade`, risk
  and allocation checks). `BUY`/positive and `SELL`/negative semantics are
  unchanged.
- **`alphalab.oms.order.Order` is the canonical lifecycle order.** The
  `alphalab.core.order` module and the `alphalab.core.Order` re-export are
  removed, along with `oms.order.Order`'s unused adapter surface
  (`to_core_order`, `from_core_order`, `canonical_order`). Every
  `oms.order.Order` field, property, and lifecycle transition is unchanged.
- **`Fill.filled_at` and `Trade.executed_at` are now `float`** (Unix seconds),
  matching every other timestamp on the execution path. They were previously
  timezone-aware `datetime`; the tz-aware `__post_init__` guard is removed. In
  `dataclasses.asdict` output these fields are now numbers, not `datetime`
  objects.
- **Removed proven-dead `alphalab.core` symbols:** `OrderCompat`, `Event`
  (`core/event.py`), `Signal` (`core/signal.py`), and the
  `alphalab.core.portfolio` / `alphalab.core.position` re-export shims. Use
  `alphalab.portfolio.engine.PortfolioState` and
  `alphalab.portfolio.position.Position` directly. `core.ids`
  (`PortfolioId` / `PositionId` / `SignalId` / `new_*`) is unaffected.
- **Package version** is `2.0.0`; the `alphalab.common.version` fallback and the
  `Development Status` classifier (`4 - Beta`) are updated to match.

---

## Added

### New packages (PR047–PR050)

- **Model Registry** (`alphalab.model_registry`) — versioned registration of
  trained model artifacts, `NONE → STAGING/PRODUCTION/ARCHIVED` promotion with an
  immutable promotions log, production rollback, and deployment metadata. Links
  to `alphalab.experiment_tracking` runs by id. State threaded functionally
  through immutable `ModelRegistry` values; no on-disk serialization.
- **AI Research Assistant** (`alphalab.research_assistant`) — deterministic,
  offline (no LLM, no network) grid-search research driver: candidate generation
  over a parameter grid, evaluation via a caller-supplied evaluator, best-first
  ranking, Markdown reporting, a one-call `run_research_workflow`, and a bridge
  that lifts a chosen candidate into an `alphalab.studio` `StrategyDefinition`.
- **Deployment Manager** (`alphalab.deployment_manager`) — packaging of
  strategy/model stacks into versioned, SHA-256-checksummed `ReleasePackage`s
  (manifest only, no artifact bytes), an append-only ledger of which release is
  active per environment, and previous-release rollback.
- **AlphaLab Enterprise** (`alphalab.enterprise`) — deterministic in-memory
  governance layer over one immutable `EnterpriseState`: session-lifecycle
  identity (no credentials accepted or stored), RBAC, append-only audit log,
  multi-user workspaces, secret *references* + rotation metadata (no secret
  values), and a compliance snapshot.

### Engine series (v1.34.0 – v1.46.0, PR034–PR046)

Delivered on `main` before the v2 line and included in 2.0.0: feature store,
factor library, options engine, futures engine, crypto engine, macro engine,
alternative data engine, machine learning engine, deep learning engine,
reinforcement learning engine, cloud research engine, cluster scheduler, and
experiment tracking. Each is a standalone deterministic package with its own
tests and benchmark.

---

## Changed — canonical execution domain models (R1–R4)

- **R1** — unified allocation/risk `Side` and `OrderRequest` into
  `alphalab.core` (see Breaking Changes). `alphalab.runtime.execution_pipeline`
  no longer converts requests field-by-field across the allocation → risk → OMS
  boundary; the `_risk_request` / `_core_side` bridges and
  `execution_adapters.core_side_from_oms` are deleted.
- **R2** — removed the five proven-dead `alphalab.core` symbols (see Breaking
  Changes). Implementations deleted outright; no aliases left behind.
- **R3** — retitled `alphalab.oms.order` as the canonical lifecycle order and
  removed its dormant adapter hooks; deleted `alphalab.core.order`. The order the
  execution pipeline produces is byte-for-byte identical.
- **R4** — `Fill.filled_at` / `Trade.executed_at` changed from `datetime` to
  `float`. `execution_adapters.canonical_execution_from_report` now passes
  `report.timestamp` straight through instead of
  `datetime.fromtimestamp(..., tz=UTC)`.

---

## Fixed

- **D1 (critical) — portfolio close/reduce cash accounting.**
  `alphalab.portfolio.engine.PortfolioEngine.apply_fill` computed
  `cash_impact = -(quantity * price) - commission + pnl`. On a closing or
  reducing fill the `+ pnl` term double-counted realized P&L into cash —
  overstating cash / NAV / `PerformanceReport.ending_capital` /
  `RiskState.current_nav` on wins and understating them on losses. The `+ pnl`
  term is removed; position cost-basis math and the
  `PositionReduced` / `PositionClosed` event payloads are unchanged. Guarded by
  new unit tests (winning, losing, and partial-reduction round-trips) and
  `tests/regression/test_close_fill_cash_accounting.py`, which drives the real
  `ExecutionPipeline` open → hold → close and asserts
  `NAV == ending_capital == risk.current_nav == starting_cash + realized_pnl - commissions`.
- **D2 (medium) — `PerformanceReport` serialization.**
  `alphalab.analytics.attribution.calculate_attribution` wrapped
  `AttributionMetrics` fields in `types.MappingProxyType`, which
  `alphalab.persistence` (via `dataclasses.asdict`) cannot copy
  (`cannot pickle 'mappingproxy' object`). It now returns ordinary `dict`s, like
  every other frozen dataclass in AlphaLab. Field names and the
  `Mapping[str, Decimal]` annotations are unchanged.

---

## Build / Packaging

- The release build and distribution validation were aligned with **Core
  Metadata 2.5 / Twine 7**. Hatchling 1.30 emits `Metadata-Version: 2.5`
  (PEP 639), which Twine 6 rejects; the dev toolchain pin is now
  `twine>=7.0,<8`, and the redundant unpinned `pip install build twine` step
  was dropped from the CI and release workflows so they use the pinned
  toolchain. `python -m build` and `twine check dist/*` pass for the 2.0.0
  wheel and sdist. Hatchling is unchanged; no application dependency changed
  (`dependencies = []`).

---

## Known gaps (unchanged in 2.0.0)

- `alphalab.runtime.execution_pipeline._trade_record` still attributes realized
  P&L by scanning portfolio events in reverse and hard-codes
  `sector_id="UNCLASSIFIED"` and `holding_period_seconds=0.0` (deferred — "D3").
- Mark-to-market position repricing is not implemented.
- `alphalab.replay` is a standalone engine; it does not drive `ExecutionPipeline`.
- `alphalab.data.feed.Bar` and `alphalab.market.bar.Bar` are separate,
  incompatible models (a third `Bar` lives in `alphalab.marketdata.feed`).
- The `broker` / `brokers`, `marketdata` / `data` / `feed`, `kernel`, and
  `core/events` areas remain intentionally unresolved / product-surface
  decisions.

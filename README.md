# What is AlphaLab?

AlphaLab is an open-source Python **library** for building deterministic quantitative research and algorithmic trading components.

It is a library, not a running application: there is no server, daemon, scheduler process, or CLI. You import the packages you need and call their pure, immutable engine APIs from your own code.

AlphaLab ships two kinds of package:

- **The integrated execution path.** `alphalab.runtime.ExecutionPipeline` is the one spine that wires several domain engines together — market data → strategy → allocation → risk → OMS → execution simulator → portfolio → analytics — as a chain of pure functions over one immutable state snapshot. `alphalab.backtesting` drives that spine from a dataset, either straight through or through `alphalab.replay`'s cursor; both call the same step, so a backtest and a replay of one dataset produce identical orders, fills and P&L.
- **Standalone engine libraries.** Most other packages (research, portfolio optimizer, feature store, factor library, ML / deep learning / RL, options / futures / crypto / macro, alternative data, cloud research, cluster scheduler, experiment tracking, model registry, research assistant, deployment manager, enterprise, studio, workbench) are independent, deterministic, individually tested libraries. They share the engineering model but are **not** currently fused into a single runtime.

The framework is designed for researchers, quantitative developers, students, and engineering teams building reproducible trading infrastructure.

# Release Status

**Current Release:** **v2.2.0**

| Metric | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Python | 3.12+ |
| Version | 2.2.0 |
| Tests | **1599 Passing** |
| Static Typing | **Strict MyPy** (870 source files) |
| Linting | **Ruff Clean** |
| Package Build | ✅ Passing |
| Wheel Validation | ✅ Passing |
| Source Distribution | ✅ Passing |
| License | MIT |

v2.2.0 — "Unified Backtesting + Replay" — adds `alphalab.backtesting`, an integration
package that turns a dataset into a run over the real execution path, and puts
`alphalab.replay` on that same path. It also closes the four v2.1 limitations that
blocked a real backtest: the quadratic OMS order book (100k order lifecycles went from
~16 minutes to 7.5s), the allocation reservation leaked on a risk rejection, the
unserializable `OMSState`, and a replay engine that produced no orders or fills. Runs
are reproducible field for field from a recorded seed. Contains one small breaking
API change — see `CHANGELOG.md`.

# Core Principles

AlphaLab is built around a consistent engineering philosophy.

- Immutable domain models
- Deterministic execution
- Event-driven architecture
- Pure functional engine APIs
- Strict static typing
- Modular package boundaries
- Production-oriented design
- Reproducible research workflows

---

# Architecture

## The integrated execution path

`alphalab.runtime.ExecutionPipeline` is the concrete, wired-together spine. One
market event flows through each stage as a pure function over an immutable
`ExecutionPipelineState`:

```text
Market event (Quote / Bar / Tick)
        │
        ▼
Strategy   →  Intents
        │
        ▼
Allocation →  sized OrderRequests            (core.OrderRequest, core.enums.Side)
        │
        ▼
Risk       →  RiskDecision (approve / reject)
        │
        ▼
OMS        →  Order lifecycle                (oms.order.Order — canonical)
        │
        ▼
Execution simulator → ExecutionReport (deterministic fills, commission)
        │
        ▼
Portfolio  →  cash, positions, realized P&L  (Fill / Trade — float timestamps)
        │
        ▼
Analytics  →  PerformanceReport (compiled on demand)
```

The caller owns the event loop and feeds events in one at a time.

## Standalone engine libraries

Everything below is importable, deterministic, and independently tested, but is
**not** currently connected into `ExecutionPipeline` or into one another:

| Area | Packages |
|---|---|
| Research & simulation | `research`, `reporting` |
| Portfolio construction | `portfolio_optimizer`, `optimizer` |
| Data surface (overlapping) | `data`, `marketdata`, `feed` |
| Features & factors | `feature_store`, `factor_library`, `alt_data` |
| Learning | `ml`, `deep_learning`, `reinforcement_learning` |
| Asset classes | `options`, `futures`, `crypto`, `macro` |
| Scale-out | `cloud_research`, `cluster_scheduler`, `distributed` |
| Lifecycle | `experiment_tracking`, `model_registry`, `deployment_manager` |
| Workflow & governance | `studio`, `workbench`, `research_assistant`, `enterprise` |
| Live / ops surface | `live`, `production`, `broker`, `brokers`, `integrations` |

> The Workbench → Studio → live-markets flow shown in `docs/` is a design target,
> not a single runtime that exists today. What is wired together is
> `ExecutionPipeline` and the `backtesting` package that drives it — including
> `replay`, as of v2.2. Market-data model convergence and live broker connectivity
> are not done; see `ROADMAP.md`.

# Learn AlphaLab

The recommended way to learn the framework is through the curated examples.

| Example | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 01 | `01_research.py` | Research Engine |
| 02 | `02_backtest.py` | Strategy Studio backtest bookkeeping |
| 03 | `03_replay.py` | Historical replay over the real execution path |
| 04 | `04_market_data.py` | Market Data |
| 05 | `05_broker_connection.py` | Broker Integrations |
| 06 | `06_portfolio_optimizer.py` | Portfolio Optimizer |
| 07 | `07_universal_data.py` | Universal Data Engine |
| 08 | `08_strategy_studio.py` | Strategy Studio |
| 09 | `09_workbench.py` | Workbench |
| 10 | `10_complete_pipeline.py` | Multi-engine walkthrough |
| 11 | `11_unified_backtest.py` | Dataset → orders → fills → P&L → analytics |

Run any example:

```bash
python examples/01_research.py
```

The example scripts date from v1.0.0 and exercise the standalone engine APIs; they
are not part of the automated test suite.

# Roadmap

## Delivered

**v1.0.0** — architectural foundation: core domain models, strategy runtime,
replay engine, portfolio optimizer, broker integration scaffolding, production
runtime, Strategy Studio, Workbench.

**v1.34.0 – v1.46.0** — engine series: feature store, factor library, options,
futures, crypto, macro, alternative data, machine learning, deep learning,
reinforcement learning, cloud research, cluster scheduler, experiment tracking.

**v2.0.0** — model registry, AI research assistant, deployment manager, AlphaLab
Enterprise; canonical execution domain-model unification (`core.enums.Side`,
`core.OrderRequest`, `oms.order.Order`, float `Fill`/`Trade` timestamps);
portfolio close/reduce cash-accounting fix; `PerformanceReport` serialization fix.

**v2.1.0** — execution and portfolio correctness: mark-to-market wired into
`ExecutionPipeline`; account-level realized P&L and commissions; the
`PortfolioValuation` read model; per-fill P&L attribution; unpriced-request and
terminal-rejection execution invariants; O(1) amortized append-only histories
(`common.AppendOnlyLog`) replacing the O(N²) tuple rebuilds.

**v2.2.0** — unified backtesting and replay: `alphalab.backtesting` composes
`ExecutionPipeline` into a real backtest, and `alphalab.replay` drives the same
path; fill policies (`ImmediateFill`, `StaticFill`, `LiquidityCappedFill`);
persistent order-book and execution-report containers
(`common.PersistentMap` / `PersistentSet`) replacing the quadratic
dict/frozenset copying; a per-order allocation
reservation ledger released exactly once; complete round-trippable `OMSState`
snapshots; seeded, reproducible identifiers.
See `CHANGELOG.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.

## Not yet addressed

- Market-data model convergence: the overlapping `data` / `market` / `marketdata` /
  `feed` surfaces and the three separate `Bar` types (v2.3)
- `broker` / `brokers` consolidation and live broker connectivity into the
  execution path (v2.3)
- A single integrated runtime spanning *all* engines (`ExecutionPipeline` and
  `backtesting` are what is wired today)
- Strategies do not see the marked portfolio: `StrategyContext` comes from the
  caller's `context_factory`
- Multi-currency valuation (`PortfolioValuation` values the base currency only)

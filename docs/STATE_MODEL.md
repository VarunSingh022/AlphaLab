# AlphaLab State Model

## Overview

Every AlphaLab subsystem owns an immutable state object representing the complete state of that subsystem.

State objects are implemented as frozen dataclasses and are never modified in place.

---

# Philosophy

Instead of mutating existing state, every operation returns a new state instance.

```
Previous State

↓

Operation

↓

New State
```

This approach simplifies testing, replay, debugging, and reasoning about system behavior.

---

# State Characteristics

Every state object should be:

- Immutable
- Typed
- Serializable
- Deterministic
- Self-contained

---

# Implementation

State objects typically use:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
```

This provides immutability and efficient memory usage.

---

# Ownership

Each package owns exactly one primary state object.

Examples:

- ResearchState
- RuntimeState
- ProductionState
- StudioState
- WorkbenchState
- IntegrationState
- PortfolioEngineState

---

# State Transitions

Every operation follows the same pattern:

```
Input State

↓

Validation

↓

Business Logic

↓

New State

↓

Events
```

The original state remains unchanged.

---

# Metadata

State objects may include metadata for extensibility, but metadata should never alter deterministic behavior.

---

# Relationship to Events

State represents the current snapshot of the system.

Events describe how the system reached that snapshot.

Both concepts complement each other but have distinct responsibilities.

---

# Benefits

- Deterministic execution
- Easier testing
- Thread safety
- Predictable replay
- Reduced side effects

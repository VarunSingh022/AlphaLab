"""The v4.3 defect-injection harness: v4.1's table, and the v4.3 programme's own series.

Kept for provenance and re-runnable, not run by the suite (it takes hours in
full). The method is v3.12's through v4.1's (``mutation_v4_1.py``), which this
script loads and runs unchanged: scratch copies of the tree, one mutation at a
time, the whole suite with ``-x``, the tests that read a clock and the
certificate's source-digest test deselected, an unmutated baseline first. The
table is v4.1's 236 mutations and one series per v4.3 milestone, each mutation a
defect that milestone's tests exist to catch (plan WS-21). Usage::

    python docs/audit/scripts/mutation_v4_3.py --check <tree>
    python docs/audit/scripts/mutation_v4_3.py <scratch-dir> --worktree [--workers N] [--only J01]

``--check`` proves only that each pattern applies exactly once; a run is what
proves a test fails. A mutation that survives a run is explained in the
progress register, beside the series' results.

Three of v4.1's patterns no longer matched the code v4.2.0 restructured -- they
fail ``mutation_v4_1.py --check`` against the v4.2.1 tag too -- and are
re-targeted here as the same defect in today's code (``RETARGETED``): X15
(observation delivery moved into the schedule cursor), A04 (``PausedReplay``
gained its schedule, book and queue) and G02 (INTEGRATION's commands name
4.2.1's assets).

M0's series:

* **J** -- WS-01: the v4.2.1 payloads and the schedule-digest pins.
* **K** -- WS-02, DET-007 and D-54-7: isolated scopes, derived registry ids.
* **L** -- WS-23, SEC-002: the HTTP transport's schemes and redirects.
* **N** -- WS-29: artifacts held to their commit, the build reproduced.
* **O** -- WS-20 and WS-00: the corrected statements and the charter.

M1's series:

* **P** -- WS-02, ADR-0053: a run held to its schedule, its provenance, and the
  manifest's identity versions. CR-53-9's three are P01 and P02 (the binding
  not checked), P03 (the digest's formula not pinned) and P04 (VERIFIED without
  the run's record).
